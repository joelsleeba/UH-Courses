$\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{H})$ is a two-sided ideal in $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{H})$

Showed that $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{H})^* = B(\mathcal{H})$ and defined
the Shatten-p class of operators.

\begin{theorem}
  $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{H})$ is the unique closed two-sided ideal in
  $B(\mathcal{H})$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $I \leqslant B(\mathcal{H})$ be a closed two-sided ideal. Then
  $\mathcal{K}(\mathcal{H}) \leqslant I$. This is because I can find
  one rank one projection in $I$, and then multiply it with unitary
  operators to get all rank one operators. Now taking the closed span
  gives me all the compact operators.

  Let $0 \ge T \in I \notin \mathcal{K}(\mathcal{H})$. (Or take
  $TT^*$). Then by spectral decomposition,
  \begin{align*}
    T = \int_{0}^{\infty}  \lambda \ d E(\lambda)
  \end{align*}
  Then there exist $\epsilon > 0$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    P = \int_{\varepsilon}^{\infty}  \ d E(\lambda)
  \end{align*}
  is infinite dimensional.

  Now the bounded Borel function $g(x) = \chi_{[\varepsilon, \infty]}
  \frac{1}{x}$ embedded into $B(\mathcal{H})$ when multiplied with
  $T$ gives $P$.
\end{proof}
