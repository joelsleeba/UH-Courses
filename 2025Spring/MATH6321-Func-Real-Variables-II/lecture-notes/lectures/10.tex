Moreover if $\|f\|_{\infty, \partial \mathbb{D}} = 0$ for some $f \in
A(\mathbb{D})$, then the maximum modulus principle forces
$\|f\|_{\infty, \mathbb{D}} = 0$. Hence we see that the restriction
of $f$ to the circle is a injective linear map. Thus we can identify
$A(\mathbb{D})$ with a closed subspace of $C(\partial \mathbb{D})$.

\begin{example}
  Consider $M : \ell^{2}(\mathbb{N}) \to \ell^{2}(\mathbb{N}):= (x_n)
  \mapsto (\frac{x_n}{n})$. Show that $M$ is not onto.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
  If $Mx = 0$, this forces $x = 0$. Thus we see that $M$ is
  injective. If $M$ were onto, then $M$ would have a bounded inverse
  by open mapping theorem. Then working with the orthonormal basis
  $\{ e_n \}$, we see that $M^{-1}(e_n)  = ne_n$, which shows that $
  \|M^{-1}\| = \infty$, a contradiction.
\end{proof}
